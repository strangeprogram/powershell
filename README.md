# PowerShell

This serves as an archive of PowerShell scripts I have created, a curated set of tools for system administrators and IT professionals. These scripts are designed to automate a variety of tasks in Windows environments, particularly focusing on Active Directory operations.

## Description

This repository contains a series of scripts that perform different tasks such as:

- User account management in Active Directory
- System health checks and monitoring
- Network configuration and analysis
- File and directory manipulation
- And more...

Each script is self-contained and documented with comments explaining its purpose and usage.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/strangeprogram/powershell`.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Review the script files to understand their functionality.
4. Execute a script with the required privileges (some scripts may require administrative rights).
